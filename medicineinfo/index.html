          <h3 class="medname">Aciclovir (Zovirax)</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            Aciclovir (or acyclovir) is an antiviral medicine. <br>
            It treats a range of infections caused by herpes viruses, including: <br>
            <li>
              cold sores
            </li>
            <li>
              genital herpes
            </li>
            <li>
              eye infections
            </li>
            Your doctor may prescribe aciclovir to prevent you getting these infections if you've had them before or if
            you have a weak immune system. <br>

            It's also used to treat chickenpox and shingles. <br>

            Aciclovir is available on prescription. It comes as tablets, a liquid that you swallow, an eye ointment, a
            cold sore cream and a cream for genital herpes. <br>

            It's sometimes given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital. <br>

            You can buy aciclovir cold sore cream at most pharmacies and shops without a prescription.
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>Start taking or using aciclovir as soon as you get the first signs of infection. </li>
            <li>For most infections, you should start to feel better after taking or using aciclovir for a few days.
            </li>
            <li>Common side effects of the tablets and liquid include headaches, feeling dizzy, and feeling or being
              sick.</li>
            <li>If aciclovir tablets or liquid make you feel dizzy, or if the eye ointment affects your vision, do not
              drive or cycle until you feel better.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands before and after using the genital herpes cream, cold sore cream or eye ointment.</li>

          <h3 class="medname">Acrivastine</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            Acrivastine is an antihistamine medicine that helps the symptoms of allergies. <br>

            It's used to treat hay fever, conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes), eczema and hives (urticaria). <br>

            It's also used for reactions to insect bites and stings and for some food allergies. <br>

            Acrivastine is known as a non-drowsy antihistamine. It's less likely to make you feel sleepy than some other
            antihistamines. <br>

            Acrivastine is available on prescription. You can also buy it from pharmacies and supermarkets. <br>

            It comes as capsules. Sometimes it's combined with a decongestant called pseudoephedrine to unblock your
            nose and sinuses. <br>

            <h4>Key Facts</h4>

            <li>It's usual to take acrivastine as you need it, up to 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>Acrivastine is classed as non-drowsy antihistamine, but some people still find it makes them feel quite
              sleepy.</li>
            <li>Common side effects include a dry mouth and dizziness.</li>
            <li>Do not drink grapefruit juice while you're taking acrivastine â€“ it might make you more likely to get
              side effects.</li>
            <li>It's best not to drink alcohol while you're taking acrivastine as it can make you feel sleepy.</li>
            <li>When acrivastine is mixed with pseudoephedrine, it's called Benadryl Allergy Relief Plus Decongestant.
              Some Benadryl products do not contain acrivastine, but a different antihistamine such as cetirizine.</li>
            <h4>Common side effects</h4>
            There are some differences between the side effects of medicines that only contain acrivastine, and
            medicines that combine acrivastine with pseudoephedrine. <br>

            The most common side effect of acrivastine is feeling sleepy and tired. This happens in more than 1 in 10
            people. <br>

            Other common side effects of acrivastine happen in more than 1 in 100 people. These include: <br>
            <li>dry mouth</li>
            <li>feeling dizzy</li>
            Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if these side effects bother you or do not go away. <br>

            The common side effects of acrivastine when mixed with pseudoephedrine happen in more than 1 in 100 people.
            They include: <br>
            <li>difficulty sleeping</li>
            <li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
            <li>headaches</li>
            <li>feeling nervous</li>
            <li>difficulty peeing (for men), especially those with an enlarged prostate</li>
            If you experience any of these, stop taking it and talk to your doctor or pharmacist about trying an
            acrivastine-only medicine. <br>

          <h3 class="medname">Adalimumab</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            How to say adalimumab: AH-dah-lee-mu-mab. <br>

            Adalimumab is a biological medicine. This means it's made from proteins or other substances produced by the
            body. It's used to reduce swelling (inflammation) by acting on your immune system. <br>

            Adalimumab is used to treat inflammation of the: <br>
            <li>joints (rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and active enthesitis-related
              arthritis)</li>
            <li>skin (plaque psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa)</li>
            <li>joints and skin (psoriatic arthritis)</li>
            <li>spine, causing back pain (axial spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis)</li>

            <li>layer beneath the white of the eyeball (non-infectious uveitis)</li> <br>

            Humira is the brand name of the original adalimumab medicine. There are now 5 newer versions of adalimumab,
            known by the brand names Amgevita, Hyrimoz, Idacio, Imraldi and Yuflyma. <br>

            These newer medicines are biosimilars. A biosimilar is a similar version of the original biological
            medicine. It works in the same way, by blocking part of your immune system to reduce inflammation. <br>

            If you switch, your body should respond the same way as if you'd stayed on Humira. You should not notice any
            difference. <br>

            Adalimumab is available on prescription. It comes as a pre-filled syringe or an injection pen that you
            inject under the skin. If you're switching from Humira to a different brand of adalimumab, the way the
            injection pen or syringe works might be different. <br>

            <h4>Key facts</h4>
            <li>Adalimumab is given by an injection under your skin. It works by blocking part of your immune system to
              reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks for adalimumab to work. It may take longer depending on your condition.</li>
            <li>Adalimumab can make you more likely to get infections. Tell your doctor if you get an infection, such as
              coronavirus (COVID-19), or if you come into contact with anyone who has shingles, chickenpox or measles.
              These infections can make you very ill. </li>
            <li>If you need to have a vaccine, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether it's a live vaccine and if there's
              an alternative inactivated vaccine available. Adalimumab may increase the risk of getting an infection
              caused by a live vaccine.</li>
            <li>You might feel dizzy or have blurred vision after taking adalimumab. If you have any of these symptoms,
              do not drive, cycle or use machinery or tools.</li>
            <li>When you start taking adalimumab you'll be given a patient alert card. Carry this with you all the time.
              It tells healthcare professionals that you're taking adalimumab. If you do not have a patient alert card,
              you can ask your specialist for one.</li>

          <h3 class="medname">Alendronic acid</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            Alendronic acid is a type of medicine called a bisphosphonate. Bisphosponates are prescribed to help your
            bones stay as strong as possible. Taking alendronic acid can help if you have, or are at risk of developing,
            osteoporosis. This is a condition that causes your bones to get weaker and be more likely to break. <br>

            Osteoporosis can happen for many reasons, but you are more likely to get it if: <br>
            <li>you're a woman who has been through the menopause</li>
            <li>you take steroids, such as prednisolone, every day for a long time (which means 3 months, or longer)
            </li>
            <li>you've had a certain type of cancer treatment â€“ some treatments can increase your risk of developing
              osteoporosis. Your oncology doctor or nurse will discuss this with you</li> <br>
            Talk to your doctor if you are worried about the health of your bones because of the medicines you take, or
            changes to your hormone levels because of the menopause. <br>

            Alendronic acidâ€¯is only available on prescription. You can take it as a standard tablet, a soluble tablet
            that dissolves in water, or as a liquid that you drink. <br> <br>
            <h4> Key facts</h4> <br>
            <li>Alendronic acid is good for your bones â€“ it makes them stronger and less likely to break.</li>
            <li>You'll usually take it as a tablet or liquid, once a week.</li>
            <li>Take alendronic acid first thing in the morning, before you have anything to eat or drink and before you
              take any other medicines. Stay sitting or standing for 30 minutes so the medicine does not irritate your
              food pipe (oesophagus).</li>
            <li>It's important to look after your teeth and have regular dental check-ups while taking alendronic acid
              because it can sometimes damage the jaw bone, but this is rare</li>
            <li>Alendronic acid is known as Fosavance when it's mixed with colecalciferol (vitamin D3)</li> <br>
            <h4> side effects</h4> <br>
            <li>a loose tooth, mouth sores, or swelling or pain in your mouth or jaw â€“ contact your dentist as well as
              your doctor, as this could be a sign of damage to your jaw bone</li>
            <li>pain, weakness or discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin â€“ this happens rarely but may be an early sign
              of a broken thigh bone</li>
            <li>severe pain in your joints, muscles or bones</li>
            <li>ear pain, discharge from your ear or an ear infection â€“ these can be signs of damage to the bones in
              your inner ear</li>
            <li>black or red poo â€“ these can be signs of an ulcer or bleeding from your gut</li>

          <div class="meddesc">

            Allopurinol is a medicine used to lower levels of uric acid in your blood. <br> <br>

            If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys do not filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny,
            sharp crystals. These crystals can form around your joints, which cause the swollen and painful symptoms of
            gout. Crystals can also collect inside the kidneys and damage them. <br> <br>

            It may also be prescribed if you're having some types of cancer treatment. Some treatments can cause a
            build-up of uric acid. <br> <br>

            Allopurinol comes as tablets and is only available on prescription. <br> <br>
            <h4>Key facts</h4>
            <li>It may take several months before you feel the full benefit of allopurinol.</li>
            <li>During the first few months of treatment, as allopurinol starts to work, you may get more gout attacks.
              However, your doctor will prescribe an NSAID such as ibuprofen, or colchicine to help with this.</li>
            <li>Drinking too much alcohol can increase the level of uric acid in your blood. This could make your gout
              worse</li>
            <li>When you take allopurinol regularly, it can lower the number of gout attacks and help prevent damage to
              the joints.</li>
            <li>Usually, you'll start allopurinol after an acute attack of gout has completely settled.</li>

          <div class="meddesc">
            Alogliptin is a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. <br>

            Type 2 diabetes is a condition where the body does not make enough insulin, or the insulin that it makes
            does not work properly. <br>

            This can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia). <br>

            Alogliptin is prescribed for people who still have high blood sugar, even though they have a sensible diet
            and exercise regularly. <br>

            It works by increasing the amount of insulin that your body makes. Insulin is the hormone that controls
            sugar levels in your blood. <br>

            Alogliptin is only available on prescription. <br>

            It comes as tablets that you swallow. It also comes as tablets containing a mixture of alogliptin and
            another diabetes medicine called metformin. This is known by the brand name Vipdomet. <br> <br>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4> <br>
            <li>Alogliptin starts to work within a few hours. You need to take it every day to make sure your blood
              sugar stays as stable as possible</li>
            <li>You take alogliptin once a day.</li>
            <li>The most common side effects of alogliptin are headaches, indigestion, diarrhoea and skin rashes.</li>
            <li>This medicine does not usually make you put on weight</li>
            <li>If you have diabetes, you're entitled to free prescriptions for all of your medicines, not just your

          <div class="meddesc">
            Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). If you have high
            blood pressure, taking amlodipine can help to prevent future heart disease, heart attacks and strokes. <br>

            It is also used to prevent chest pain caused by heart disease (angina). <br>


            Amlodipine helps high blood pressure by relaxing and widening blood vessels. This lowers your blood pressure
            and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. <br>

            With angina, you usually get chest pain because the arteries going to the heart have become hardened and
            narrowed. Amlodipine helps by improving the blood and oxygen supply to your heart. <br>

            This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or as a liquid you swallow. <br>
            <h4>Key facts</h4>
            <li>You'll usually take amlodipine once a day. You can take it at any time, but try to make sure it's around
              the same time each day.</li>
            <li>Amlodipine can make some people feel dizzy. If this happens to you, do not drive a car, ride a bike, or
              use tools or machinery until you feel better.</li>
            <li>The most common side effects include headaches, flushing, feeling tired and swollen ankles. These
              usually improve after a few days.</li>
            <li>Amlodipine can also be called amlodipine besilate, amlodipine maleate or amlodipine mesilate. They have
              different ingredients but they all work as well as each other.</li>
            <li>Having large amounts of grapefruit or grapefruit juice can increase the amount of amlodipine in your
              body and make side effects worse.</li> <br>

            Aspirin is an everyday painkiller for aches and pains such as headache, toothache and period pain. It can
            also be used to treat colds and flu-like symptoms, and to bring down a high temperature. <br>

            Aspirin is known as an acetylsalicylic acid. It also belongs to a group of medicines called non-steroidal
            anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). <br>

            Aspirin combined with other ingredients is also available in some cold and flu remedies. <br>

            You can buy most types of aspirin from pharmacies, shops and supermarkets. Some types are only available on
            prescription. <br>

            Aspirin comes as tablets or suppositories â€“ medicine that you push gently into your anus (bottom). It also
            comes as a gel for mouth ulcers and cold sores. <br>

            If you've had a stroke or heart attack, or are at high risk of a heart attack, your doctor may recommend
            that you take a daily low-dose aspirin. Some women may also be prescribed low-dose aspirin while theyâ€™re
            pregnant. <br>

            This is different to taking aspirin for pain relief. Only take low-dose aspirin if your doctor recommends
            it. Read our information on low-dose aspirin. <br>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>It's best to take aspirin with food. That way, you'll be less likely to get an upset stomach or stomach
              ache.</li>
            <li>Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16 (unless their doctor prescribes it). It can make
              children more likely to develop a very rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.</li>
            <li>You should start to feel better 20 to 30 minutes after taking aspirin.</li>
            <li>Aspirin is an ingredient in combined medicines such as Anadin Original, Anadin Extra, Alka-Seltzer
              Original, Alka-Seltzer XS and Beechams Powders.</li>
            <li>Aspirin as a mouth gel has the brand name Bonjela. Like other aspirin products, it's only for people

            Your doctor may suggest that you take a daily low dose if you have had a stroke or a heart attack to help
            stop you having another one. <br>

            Or, if you're at high risk of heart attack â€“ for example, if you have had heart surgery or if you have chest
            pain (angina) caused by heart disease. <br>

            If youâ€™re pregnant, you may be recommended to take low-dose aspirin <br>

            <li>youâ€™re at risk of high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia)</li>
            <li>you have underlying medical conditions where you have been advised to take low dose aspirin</li>
            <li>you have had several miscarriages or complications in a previous pregnancy</li>
            Only take daily low-dose aspirin if your doctor recommends it. <br>

            Low-dose aspirin comes as tablets, including tablets that dissolve in a drink of water (soluble) and tablets
            with a special coating (enteric coated/gastro-resistant) to help to protect your stomach. <br>

            It's available on prescription. You can also buy it from pharmacies. However, if youâ€™re pregnant, or having
            fertility treatment, low-dose aspirin will need to be prescribed by your doctor, a pregnancy specialist
            (obstetrician) or a midwife. <br>

            Children are sometimes treated with low-dose aspirin after heart surgery or to treat a rare condition called
            Kawasaki disease. Children should only take low-dose aspirin if a doctor prescribes it. <br>

            Taking low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks and strokes is not the same as taking aspirin for pain
            relief. <br>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>Daily low-dose aspirin makes your blood less sticky and helps to prevent heart attacks and stroke.</li>
            <li>Youâ€™ll usually take a dose of 75mg once a day. Sometimes, doses are higher.</li>
            <li>It's best to take low-dose aspirin with food so it does not upset your stomach.</li>
            <li>Only take low-dose aspirin if your doctor or midwife recommends it, especially if you are pregnant or
              breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Carry on taking daily low-dose aspirin even if you feel well, as you'll still be getting the benefits.

            <li>Taking azathioprine can mean you're more likely to get infections. Ask your doctor for urgent advice
              if you get an infection, such as coronavirus (COVID-19), or if you've been in contact with anyone who
              has chickenpox or shingles while taking azathioprine.</li>
            <li>It's important to have any vaccinations when you're invited. Tell the person giving the vaccine that
              you take azathioprine, to make sure the vaccine is suitable for you.</li>
            <li>Use a sunscreen while taking azathioprine, as this medicine can make your skin more sensitive to
              sunlight.</li>
            <li>It's best not to drink too much alcohol, as azathioprine and alcohol can both affect your liver.

          <h3 class="medname">Azithromycin</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            Azithromycin is an antibiotic medicine. <br>

            It's used to treat infections including: <br>
            <li>chest infections such as pneumonia</li>
            <li>ear, nose and throat and nose infections such as sinus infection (sinusitis)</li>
            <li>skin infections</li>
            <li>Lyme diseasesome </li>
            <li>some sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</li>
            It can also be used long-term to prevent chest infections in people who keep getting them. <br>

            Azithromycin is from a group of medicines called macrolide antibiotics. Macrolide antibiotics work by
            killing the bacteria that cause the infection. <br>

            Azithromycin is available on prescription as capsules, tablets and a liquid that you swallow. It can
            also be given by injection, but this is usually only done in hospital. <br>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>You'll usually take azithromycin once a day. Try to take it at the same time each day.</li>
            <li>Take azithromycin capsules at least 1 hour before food or 2 hours after eating. You can take tablets or
              liquid with or without food</li>
            <li>For most infections you should feel better within a few days, but it's important to finish your full
              course of medicine.</li>
            <li>The most common side effects of azithromycin are feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, headaches, or changes
              to your sense of taste.</li>
            <li>Some people get a fungal infection called thrush after taking a course of antibiotics like azithromycin.
              Symptoms of thrush in the mouth include redness and itching. Women may get vaginal itching.</li>

            Baclofen is a muscle relaxant. <br>

            It's used to relieve muscle spasms, cramping or tightness caused by conditions such as: <br>
            <li>cerebral palsy</li>
            <li>meningitis</li>
            <li>motor neurone disease</li>
            <li>multiple sclerosis</li>
            <li>conditions affecting your brain, spinal cord and nervous system</li>
            Baclofen is available on prescription. It comes as tablets or a liquid that you swallow. <br>

            If baclofen tablets or liquid do not work well for you or your child, you may be prescribed a baclofen
            injection. This will be given by a specialist doctor in hospital. Baclofen can also be given through a pump
            that is fitted under the skin. <br>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>Baclofen reduces pain and discomfort caused by muscle spasms.</li>
            <li>The tablets and liquid start to work after 1 hour after taking it. However, it might take a few days
              before you find the right dose to control your symptoms.</li>
            <li>Common side effects include feeling sleepy and feeling sick (nausea).</li>
            <li>If your doctor decides to stop your treatment, your dose will be reduced gradually over 1 to 2 weeks.
            </li>
            <li>It's best not to drink alcohol while you are taking baclofen until you know how it affects you. There's
              a risk alcohol may increase drowsy side effects and make you very sleepy.</li>

          <h3 class="medname">Beclometasone inhalers</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            Beclometasone is a type of medicine known as aâ€¯steroid (also called a corticosteroid). It's mainly used for
            asthma, but also sometimes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). <br>

            Steroids closely copy the effects of natural hormones produced in your adrenal glands. The adrenal glands
            are above your kidneys. <br>

            Steroid inhalers work as a preventer by calming down your immune system. This reduces the swelling in your
            lungs that makes it difficult to breathe. <br>

            You can take beclometasone using an inhaler (sometimes called a "puffer"), which is usually brown or beige,
            or sometimes red or pink. This is called a "preventer" inhaler because it helps to prevent you from getting
            symptoms. <br>

            Beclometasone on its own does not work as a reliever (to relieve any symptoms when you get them). It cannot
            treat an asthma attack when you suddenly get coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. <br>

            Some inhalers contain beclometasone mixed with other medicines that help your breathing (bronchodilators).
            <br>

            A beclometasone inhaler containing formoterol (brand names Fostair or Luforbec) may be used as both a
            preventer and a reliever for asthma. <br>

            Beclometasone also comes as <br>
            <li>nose spray (nasal spray) â€“ for hay fever and cold-like symptoms caused by common allergies (rhinitis)
            </li>
            <li>cream and ointment â€“ for skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis</li>
            <li>tablets â€“ for ulcerative colitis</li>
            <h4>Key Facts</h4>
            <li>A beclometasone inhaler does not work straight away. You need to use your beclometasone inhaler every
              day for it to work, even if you do not have any symptoms.</li>
            <li>It's important to rinse your mouth or brush your teeth after using a steroid inhaler. This is to prevent
              infections and a sore mouth.</li>
            <li>You may get a blue steroid treatment card if you need high doses of beclometasone to control your
              symptoms. You may also need to carry a steroid emergency card. Ask your pharmacist or doctor about these.
            </li>
            <li>You'll usually be given another inhaler, called a reliever, to relieve your symptoms when they happen.

            Beclometasone (also called "beclomethasone") is a type of medicine known as a steroid (or corticosteroid).
            Corticosteroids are a copy of a substance the body makes naturally. Theyâ€™re not the same asâ€¯anabolic

            Beclometasone nasal spray is available on prescription for adults and children aged 6 years old and over.
            You can also buy it from pharmacies and shops for adults aged 18 years old and over. <br>

            <li>You need to use beclometasone nasal spray regularly for it to work.</li>
            <li>Beclometasone nasal spray takes a few days to work fully. For some people it can take 2 weeks or more to
              get the maximum benefits.</li>
            <li>The most common side effects are an unpleasant taste or smell, and a dry or sore throat.</li>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Hydrocortisone buccal tablets are a specific form of hydrocortisone medication designed to be placed
              against the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa) where it slowly dissolves and is absorbed through the oral
              mucosa. They are used for conditions requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment, such as adrenal
              insufficiency or Addison's disease, characterized by insufficient production of cortisol by the adrenal
              glands.</p>

            <h4>Uses</h4>
            <p>Hydrocortisone buccal tablets are used to:</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Administration</h4>

              without chewing or swallowing. They are usually taken at specific intervals or as directed by the
              healthcare provider.</p>

            <h4>Effectiveness</h4>
            <p>Hydrocortisone buccal tablets effectively supplement cortisol levels in individuals with adrenal
              insufficiency, helping to manage symptoms and prevent complications associated with low cortisol levels.
            </p>

            <h4>Side Effects</h4>

              application site, oral candidiasis (fungal infection in the mouth), or changes in taste sensation.
              Systemic side effects are less likely due to the slow absorption through the buccal mucosa.</p>

            <h4>Precautions</h4>
            <p>Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider. Avoid chewing or swallowing the tablets.
              It's essential to have regular check-ups and follow-ups with your doctor to monitor the condition and

            It appears that "Cheston Cold" might be a brand or product name that combines multiple medications to

            symptoms like cough, congestion, runny nose, fever, and body aches. <br>

            Typically, these combinations may include a pain reliever/fever reducer (such as Paracetamol or
            Acetaminophen), an antihistamine (like Chlorpheniramine), a decongestant (like Phenylephrine or
            Pseudoephedrine), and sometimes a cough suppressant (such as Dextromethorphan). <br>

            As "Cheston Cold" is a branded medication, the exact formulation and ingredients might vary based on the

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Pravastatin is available in tablet form and is taken orally, typically once daily.</li>
              <li>It is prescribed to lower high levels of LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides while
                increasing HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).</li>
              <li>Pravastatin is often part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes lifestyle changes such as
                diet, exercise, and weight management.</li>
              <li>The dosage and duration of treatment are determined based on the individual's lipid profile and
                cardiovascular risk.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Some individuals may experience more severe side effects such as muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) or
                liver problems. Seek medical attention if these occur.</li>
              <li>Pravastatin may interact with other medications, so it's important to inform your healthcare provider
                about all medications you are taking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Precautions</h4>

          <h3 class="medname">Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)</h3>
          <div class="meddesc">
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a preventative medication regimen used to reduce the risk of HIV
              infection in individuals at high risk of acquiring the virus.</p>

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>PrEP involves taking antiretroviral medications daily, typically a combination of tenofovir disoproxil
                fumarate and emtricitabine.</li>
              <li>It is recommended for individuals who are HIV-negative but at high risk of exposure to HIV, such as
                individuals with an HIV-positive partner, individuals engaging in unprotected sex, or people who inject
                drugs.</li>
              <li>PrEP is most effective when taken consistently every day and combined with other preventive measures
                such as condom use and regular HIV testing.</li>
              <li>Before starting PrEP, individuals should undergo HIV testing to confirm that they are HIV-negative and
                should be regularly monitored for HIV status and side effects while taking PrEP.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Side Effects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Common side effects may include nausea, headache, diarrhea, or fatigue, which are usually mild and
                transient.</li>
              <li>Some individuals may experience more severe side effects or changes in kidney function. Regular
                monitoring is necessary to detect and manage any adverse effects.</li>
              <li>PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so other preventive
                measures may still be needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Precautions</h4>
            <p>PrEP is not a substitute for safer sex practices. Individuals on PrEP should continue using condoms and
              other preventive measures to reduce the risk of HIV and other STIs.</p>
            <p>Regular medical check-ups and HIV testing are essential while on PrEP to monitor for HIV infection and
              assess any potential side effects.</p>
            <p>PrEP should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional and should not be shared with
              others.</p>
