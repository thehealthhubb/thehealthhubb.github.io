            <br>

            <h4>Cold or Warm Compress:</h4>

            Apply a cold or warm compress to your forehead or the back of your neck for about 15 minutes. Experiment
            with both to see which works best for you. <br>

            <h4>Massage:</h4>

            Gently massage your temples, neck, and shoulders to help relax tense muscles. <br>

            <h4>Caffeine:</h4>

            A small amount of caffeine may provide relief for some people. This can be in the form of tea, coffee, or a

            few minutes. This is a common acupressure point thought to help relieve headaches. <br>

            <h4>Hydrating Foods:</h4>

            Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress and tension. <br>

            <h4>Relaxation Techniques:</h4>
            Identify and avoid triggers that may contribute to your headaches, such as certain foods, lack of sleep, or

        <h3 class="medname">Oily Skin</h3>
        <div class="meddesc">
          <h4>Gentle Cleansing</h4>
          <p>Wash your face twice daily with a gentle, oil-free, or foaming cleanser to remove excess oil and impurities. Avoid harsh products that strip the skin of moisture.</p>
          
          <h4>Use Oil-Free Products</h4>
          <p>Choose skincare products labeled "oil-free" or "non-comedogenic" to avoid clogging pores. Look for lightweight, water-based moisturizers and oil-free sunscreen.</p>
          
          <h4>Use Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl Peroxide</h4>
          <p>Consider using products containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help control oil and prevent breakouts. Start with a lower concentration to avoid irritation.</p>
          
          <h4>Blotting Papers</h4>
          <p>Carry blotting papers or oil-absorbing sheets to gently dab away excess oil during the day without disrupting makeup.</p>
          
          <h4>Avoid Over-Washing</h4>
          <p>While it's important to keep the skin clean, over-washing can stimulate more oil production. Stick to washing your face twice a day.</p>
          
          <h4>Exfoliation</h4>
          <p>Regular exfoliation (1-2 times a week) with a gentle scrub or chemical exfoliant can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores.</p>
          
          <h4>Hydration</h4>
          <p>Even oily skin needs hydration. Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer to maintain skin hydration without adding excess oil.</p>
          
          <h4>Diet and Lifestyle</h4>
          <p>Avoiding greasy or processed foods and staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water may help manage oil production. Also, managing stress levels can indirectly impact oiliness.</p>
          
          <h4>Makeup Removal</h4>
          <p>Ensure thorough makeup removal before bed to prevent buildup that can clog pores overnight.</p>
          
          <h4>Sun Protection</h4>
          <p>Use a non-comedogenic sunscreen daily to protect the skin from sun damage. Look for products specifically formulated for oily skin.</p>
